# Machines-Fault-Prediction-using-RNN-and-LSTM

This project is just done for fun. Instead of using Machine Learning algorithms, I tried of the neural network model in a Sequential data format.
Genrally RNN is used for natural language processing to predict the next word or used in computer vision to write a sentece that what's happening in an
image scene.

 So, here I just tried out the Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) for .csv based file where it contains the readings of 52 sensors for fault prediction. And to overcome the
 Stochastic Gradient Problem The Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) is used to improve the accuracy of the model.
